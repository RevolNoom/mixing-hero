- Do not access child nodes at _init(), they are not instantiated yet. Access them at _ready()

- Do not multi-inherit a class with a Godot class and another. For example:
	class A: public Other, public GodotNode
  This will result in the dynamic library unusable

- Don't forget that your code needs to be compiled to take effect. The Sconstruct only compile the *.cpp

- In register_method, if you pass an invalid(?) function pointer, it will not be known

- Some Script variables might not appear even though registered properly. You must restart Godot to see them.

- Variant can't cast to your custom class, so, function like these won't work:
	class CustomClass: public GodotClass
	{
		GODOT_CLASS(CustomClass, GodotClass);
		void function(CustomClass c);
	}
	
	void function(CustomClass c) is implicitly converted from void function(Variant c). Variant does not know how to cast to CustomClass, but it knows how to cast to a pointer of CustomClass, so this works:
	
	void function(CustomClass *c);
